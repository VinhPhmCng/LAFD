  <p>
    Up until now, variables have been storing only one value. Suppose we have a program that stores perfect square numbers. It might look like this:
  </p>

  <program language="python">
    <input>
      ps1 = 0
      ps2 = 1
      ps3 = 4
      ps4 = 9
      # ...
      ps100 = 9801
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    In order to reduce the number of variables, we can make use of a new object<mdash></mdash><term>data structures</term>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-data-structure">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <term>A data structure</term> is a special data that acts as a storage for multiple other pieces of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each piece of <q>sub-data</q> stored by a data structure is called an <term>element</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data structures are <em>built on top of</em> data types, meaning concepts in <xref ref="sec-data-type"/> can be applied to them.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  
  <p>
    Then, we can re-implement our program as follows:
  </p>
  
  <program language="python">
    <input>
      import numpy as np # Use library Numpy
      ps = np.array([0, 1, 4, 9, ..., 9801])
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    Instead of creating 100 different variables, we can now create just one, which holds 100 values. (You don't have to care about the syntax yet.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Every programming language has its own set of built-in data structures, all of which are different in some way.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this book, the two most important data structures have got to be <term>arrays</term> and <term>matrices</term>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following sub-sections will only <em>briefly introduce</em> these two objects. If you are interested in their syntax or how to work with them, please refer to <xref provisional="sec-lap-trinh-mo-rong"/>.
  </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-array">
    <title>Arrays</title>

    <definition xml:id="def-array">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>array</term> can store multiple values at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          All elements of an array must have <em>the same data type</em>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For example:
    </p>

    <sage language="python">
      <input>
        import numpy as np # Use library Numpy

        arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        print(arr, type(arr))
      </input>
    </sage>
    <problem>
      <pre>
        [1 2 3] &lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;
      </pre>
    </problem>
    <investigation>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        We declare an array with 3 elements, all of which are integers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The command <c>type()</c> lets us know its data type is <c>numpy.ndarray</c>, which can be understood as <q>array of Numpy</q>.
      </p>
    </investigation>
    
    <p>
      If we gives an array a mixed collection of <c>int</c> and <c>float</c>, then it <em>automatically</em> converts its elements so that their data types match.
    </p>
    
    <sage language="python">
      <input>
        import numpy as np # Use library Numpy

        arr1 = np.array([1, 2.5, 3])
        print(arr1)

        arr2 = np.array([1, "test", 3])
        print(arr2)
      </input>
    </sage>
    <problem>
      <pre>
        [1.  2.5 3. ]
        ['1' 'test' '3']
      </pre>
    </problem>
    <investigation>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The array <c>arr1</c> realizes the floating-point element <c>2.5</c>, so it converts all the integers into <c>float</c>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the array <c>arr2</c> automatically converts all of its elements into <c>str</c>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-matrix">
    <title>Matrices</title>

    <definition xml:id="def-matrix">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>matrix</term> can store multiple values at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          A matrix is <term>two-dimensional</term>, meaning its elements are organized into <term>rows</term> and <term>columns</term>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All elements of a matrix must have <em>the same data type</em>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <sage language="python">
      <input>
        import numpy as np # Use library Numpy

        mat = np.matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6]])
        print(mat, type(mat))
      </input>
    </sage>
    <problem>
      <pre>
        [[1 2 3]
         [2 4 6]] &lt;class 'numpy.matrix'&gt;
      </pre>
    </problem>
    <investigation>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        We declare a matrix with 6 integer elements. Row 1 has 3 elements <c>1 2 3</c>, and row 2 has 3 elements <c>2 4 6</c>. (So, this is a 2-by-3 matrix.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The command <c>type()</c> lets us know its data type is <c>numpy.matrix</c>, which can be understood as <q>matrix of Numpy</q>.
      </p>
    </investigation>
    
    <p>
      To improve readability, a matrix can be declared as follows:
    </p>

    <sage language="python">
      <input>
        import numpy as np # Use library Numpy

        mat = np.matrix(
          [
            [1, 2, 3],
            [2, 4, 6]
          ]
        )
        print(mat, type(mat))
      </input>
    </sage>
    <problem>
      <pre>
        [[1 2 3]
         [2 4 6]] &lt;class 'numpy.matrix'&gt;
      </pre>
    </problem>
    <investigation>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This code runs completely the same as before.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this representation, we can easily see the number of rows and columns.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also shows an interesting fact<mdash></mdash>a matrix is a big array whose elements are smaller arrays.
      </p>
    </investigation>

    <p>
      And similar to arrays, a matrix automatically converts its elements so that their data types match.
    </p>
    
    <sage language="python">
      <input>
        import numpy as np # Use library Numpy

        mat = np.matrix(
          [
            [1, 2.5, 3],
            [2, 4, 6]
          ]
        )
        print(mat)
      </input>
    </sage>
    <problem>
      <pre>
        [[1.  2.5 3. ]
         [2.  4.  6. ]]
      </pre>
    </problem>
    <investigation>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The matrix sees the floating-point element <c>2.5</c>, so it converts all the other integers into <c>float</c>.
      </p>
    </investigation>
