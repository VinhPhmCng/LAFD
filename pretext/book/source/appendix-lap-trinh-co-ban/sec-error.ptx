  <p>
    Congratulations! You have equipped yourself with programming fundamentals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, to improve your learning journey and experience, you should know how to deal with <term>errors</term>. For frequently seen errors, please refer to <xref provisional="cac-loi-thuong-gap"/>. We will now go into some basic knowledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Như đã đề cập đến, lỗi, nếu có, sẽ được thông báo ở <term>terminal</term>. Một vài thông tin kèm theo lỗi bao gồm:
    As previously mentioned, errors, if any, will be shown in the <term>terminal</term>. Some additional pieces information about an error are:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Dòng phát hiện lỗi
          The line on which the error is spotted
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The type of the error
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A description of the error
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <etc></etc>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Here are some examples picked from previous sections:
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      print("Hello world!")
      print("This is a string.")
      print("This is another string.) 
    </input>
  </sage>
  <problem>
    <pre>
      Cell In [1], line 3
        print("This is another string.)
              ^
      SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 3)
    </pre>
  </problem>
  <investigation>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      An error is spotted in line 3, which is of type <c>SyntaxError</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading the description and taking another look at line 3, we can easily see that we are missing a quotation mark.
    </p>
  </investigation>

  <sage language="python">
    <input>
      a = 5
      s = "string"
      print(a + s)
    </input>
  </sage>
  <problem>
    <pre>
      TypeError
      Cell In [1], line 3

      ...

      TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
    </pre>
  </problem>
  <investigation>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      An error of type <c>TypeError</c> is spotted at line 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      The description simply means that addition between an integer and a string is unsupported.
    </p>
  </investigation>

  <sage language="python">
    <input>
      import numpy as np # Use library Numpy
      print(np.sqrt("hello?"))
    </input>
  </sage>
  <problem>
    <pre>
      TypeError
      Cell In [1], line 2

      ...

      TypeError: ufunc 'sqrt' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''
    </pre>
  </problem>
  <investigation>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      An error of type <c>TypeError</c> is spotted at line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      The description might be long, but essentially it reads <q>a string cannot be passed into the function sqrt</q>.
    </p>
  </investigation>

  <p>
    But what should you do if you are even more confused after reading the terminal?

    <title>How To Fix An Error</title>

    <p>
      There is no programmer, however skilled, who is able to memorize every potential error. It is totally normal for a senior programmer to look up errors on the Internet, even ones they've fixed before. Of course, the more errors they deal with, the more experience they accumulate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hiện tượng trên là hoàn toàn bình thường. Vậy nên, dưới đây tôi sẽ chỉ cho bạn một vài <em>kinh nghiệm</em> trong việc sửa lỗi. Khi gặp bất kỳ lỗi nào, ta có thể lần lượt đi qua các bước sau.
      Coming up are some of my personal experiences in fixing errors. You can try out these approaches one after another:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <!--  -->
            <term>Fix it</term><mdash />In the case the error is easily understood, you can just fix it. Otherwise, we continue with the next step.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Search on the Internet</term><mdash />You can look it up by copy-pasting its description.
          </p>

          <note>
            <p>
              You should include the programming language being used as a keyword to increase efficiency, for instance, <q>python unterminated string literal...</q>.
            </p>
          </note>

          <remark>
            <p>
              You can refer to documentations in your language of choice. But it is commonly the case that English documentations are better in terms of availability and being up-to-date.
            </p>
          </remark>

          <p>
            Phần lớn các lỗi mà bạn có thể gặp phải đều đã có người trải qua trước đó rồi. Ta có thể nhanh chóng đọc những bài đăng bàn luận về lỗi mà ta đang gặp phải, tham khảo cách giải quyết của họ. Một vài diễn đàn phổ biến nhất là <term>Stack Overflow</term>, <term>Github</term>, <term>Stack Exchange</term>, <term>Reddit</term>. <!--  --> 
            The majority of errors you might run into have already been solved by others. Thus, we can quickly read online posts and discussions and learn their solutions. Some of the most popular forums are <term>Stack Overflow</term>, <term>Github</term>, <term>Stack Exchange</term>, <term>Reddit</term>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, if you are still unable to fix it, or you run into another one, you can repeat the process, or proceed to step 3.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Describe it yourself</term><mdash />It seems others' solutions don't apply to you when using the provided description. In that case, why don't you try to detail it using your own words? Describe what you are trying to achieve, with which data types, with which language, and maybe your suspicion of why the error occurs, <etc></etc>. Not working? Let's move to the next approach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Using artificial intelligence (AI)</term><mdash />If possible, you should try taking advantage of AI models such as <term>ChatGPT</term> or <term>Github Copilot</term> to fix errors. This is becoming an increasingly popular and effective approach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Make a post</term><mdash></mdash>When all other means have failed, it's time for you to request help from other human programmers. You can go into programming forums and compose a post detailing your problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure to study online <term>etiquettes</term> to know how to behave appropriately when using such forums. Because you are looking for others' help, being respectful is vital.
          </p>
